# Organizing Bears Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a new table with various data types
- Use the `INSERT INTO` command to insert data (i.e. rows) into a database table
- Use the `SELECT` command with various functions and modifiers to write queries

## Lab Structure

This lab might seem a bit different than what you've seen before. Take a look at
the file structure and read the comments to understand what each file is used
for:

```txt
├── Gemfile
├── README.md
├── config
│   └── environment.rb # requires bundler and files
├── lib
│   ├── create.sql     # where you CREATE your schema
│   ├── insert.sql     # where you INSERT your data
│   ├── seed.sql       # data for in-memory test database
│   ├── sql_queries.rb # where you write your SELECT queries
└── spec               # all the specs
    ├── create_spec.rb # this tests your create.sql file
    ├── insert_spec.rb # this tests your insert.sql file
    ├── select_spec.rb # this tests the queries you write in sql_queries.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb
```

This lab uses the `sqlite3` gem to allow us to connect to a SQL database from
Ruby. How cool is that!? We'll use this gem more in the lessons to come.

To install the `sqlite3` gem, run:

```console
bundle install
```

Running `bundle install` is a good habit to get into when setting up new Ruby
applications with a `Gemfile`. As a reminder, the `Gemfile` is where we specify
the dependencies for a Ruby application. Running `bundle install` will download
the gems listed in this file to your system.

In case you forget though, running `bin/rspec` will **also** run
`bundle install` if you haven't already installed the necessary gems.

### A Note on Testing

Let's briefly go over what is happening in setup blocks that our tests
will be using.

```ruby
let(:db) do
  SQLite3::Database.new(':memory:')
end

before do
  sql = File.read("lib/create.sql")
  db.execute_batch(sql)
end
```

Before each test, two important things happen.

First, a new _in-memory_ database is created. Why do we do this instead of
creating a database file? Let's say we run our tests and they add ten items to
our database. If we did not use an in-memory store, those would be in there
forever. This way, our database gets thrown out after every running of the
tests. You can learn more about in-memory databases
[here](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html).

Next, the test opens the `.sql` file, and runs the SQL code in that file in
that in-memory database.

## Part 1: `CREATE TABLE`

Get the tests in `spec/create_spec.rb` to pass by writing code in the
`lib/create.sql` file. Your `CREATE` statement should look something like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bears (
  //columns here
);
```

Your columns should be the following types:

| column      | type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | integer |
| name        | text    |
| age         | integer |
| sex         | text    |
| color       | text    |
| temperament | text    |
| alive       | boolean |

Read about [SQLite3 Datatypes](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) to
determine what your insert values are going to be. Be sure to pay attention to
how booleans are expressed in SQLite3.

## Part 2: `INSERT`

Get the tests in `spec/insert_spec.rb` to pass by writing code in the
`lib/insert.sql` file. Input the following 8 bears (you can make up details
about them, but make sex either 'M' or 'F'):

- Mr. Chocolate
- Rowdy
- Tabitha
- Sergeant Brown
- Melissa
- Grinch
- Wendy
- unnamed (refer back to how to create a record that doesn't have one value)

## Part 3: `SELECT`

Get the tests in `spec/select_spec.rb` to pass. Note that for this section, the
database will be seeded with external data from the `lib/seed.sql` file so don't
expect it to reflect the data you added above.

**Note**: Since it's a Ruby file, write your queries as strings within methods
in the `lib/sql_queries.rb` file. For example, to pass the first test, your Ruby
method should look like this:

```rb
def selects_all_female_bears_return_name_and_age
  "SELECT bears.name, bears.age FROM bears WHERE sex='F';"
end
```

You can also write the SQL strings in a Ruby [heredoc][heredoc] to help with
formatting:

```rb
def selects_all_female_bears_return_name_and_age
  <<-SQL
    SELECT
      bears.name,
      bears.age
    FROM
      bears
    WHERE
      sex='F';
  SQL
end
```

You may be expected to use SQL statements that you're not particularly familiar
with. Make sure you use the resources and Google to find the right statements.
